Creative Portion Mod 6:

Leave Room:

To make our site more intuitive to navigate, we added a leave room button for users to press when they were in a room. This seemed like an obvious choice to add, given that it wasn’t specifically mentioned in the rubric, and while it isn’t the flashiest concept to add, it strongly boosts the functionality of our chat site as a whole. 

Delete Room:

This function allows the admin (creator of the room), and only the admin, to delete the room at the press of a button. The button, when pressed, deletes the room entirely from the site and kicks every user back into the lobby. This function gives a lot more administrative power to users who have ownership of a room (beyond kicking/banning), and we felt that it was a good thing to implement for our site to be more well rounded.

Transfer Admin:

This function allows the admin, and only the admin, to transfer admin status from themselves onto another user. This user then has all the administrative powers of the original admin, while the original admin’s powers in that room are reduced to that of a joined user in the room (chatting, leaving). This feature gives administration on our site a bit more flexibility, and makes ownership of a room less rigid. 

Example Application of Creative Portion Features:

The following is a broad example of how the features of our creative portion could be used. With the ability to join and leave rooms rapidly, users can weave in and out of different chatrooms, perhaps stopping by to say hi in the “We Hate Socket.IO” chatroom, and then leaving to join the “Why Are We Comp Sci Majors” chatroom to commiserate with their fellow 330 students about how hard Module 6 was. Our two additional administrative features also lend themselves to a more complete chatroom experience for both users and admins (users can be either/or depending on the room!). Maybe I own a chatroom called “I am happy” and decide that I am no longer qualified to be a part of the chatroom, so I transfer administrative duties to another, hopefully happier, user. I could even decide that happiness itself is unattainable by anyone, and delete the whole room!
